Welcome Minecraft enthusiasts! This is a guide on how to install the **minecraft.js** package, which allows you to create your own Minecraft server using JavaScript. The package is available on npm and can be installed using various package managers.

- [Github Repository](https://github.com/drixswe/minecraft.js)
- [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft.js)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), to write and edit your code.
- An existing JavaScript or TypeScript project, or create a new one.

### Installation

Installing **minecraft.js** is quick and easy. Just run the following command for your favourite package manager in your project directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="npm">
    ```shell
    # Install the minecraft.js package using npm
    npm install minecraft.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```shell
    # Install the minecraft.js package using yarn
    yarn add minecraft.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```shell
    # Install the minecraft.js package using pnpm
    pnpm add minecraft.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
    ```shell
    # Install the minecraft.js package using bun
    bun add minecraft.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the minecraft.js package. You can now start building your own Minecraft server using JavaScript.

### Launch the server

To launch the server, you can create a simple JavaScript or TypeScript file and import the [Server](/en/reference/server) class. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript title="server.js"
import { Server } from 'minecraft.js'

const server = new Server()
server.start()
```

Congratulations! You can now run this file using your terminal. To stop the server, you can use `Ctrl + C` in your terminal or call the `server.stop()` method in your code.
